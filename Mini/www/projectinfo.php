					<ul>
					<li><b>M.I.N.I</b> is a Software Engineering 1 course's Project for level 2 students in Faculty of Computers and Information , Helwan University.</li>
					<li>It stands for "<b>MINI Is Not Impossible</b>" which would be considered a recursive acronym.</li></br>
					<li>Its main idea is creating a website that could manage the faculty's database in order to come up with a Time Schedule, with the least amount of conflicts arising.</li></br>
					<li>Many people said such project would be quite impossible since there will always be conflicts , but we have decided to accept that challenge and aspire to do
					something outstanding that could help our Faculty manage its Time-tables with maximum satisfaction and minimum risk of conflicts between lectures and lab sections as possible.</li></br>
					<li>To do so, we decided to apply a series of actions that are backed up by the genetic algorithm and try to generate a schedule that satisfies all conditions given
					by the help of our Database.</li></br>
