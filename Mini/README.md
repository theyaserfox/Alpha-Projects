# Purpose
Making a class schedule is one of those NP hard problems. The problem can be solved
using a heuristic search algorithm to find the optimal solution, but it only works for
simple cases. For more complex inputs and requirements, finding a considerably good
solution can take a while, or it may be impossible. This is where genetic algorithms come
in to the game. This software web system implements genetic algorithms to achieve the
optimal scheduale for college semsters.


# Scope of Project
This software system should generate all the optimal solutions for a college depending
on itâ€™s resources, The system designed to minimize conflicts between rooms, professor
place and student group place, also it makes sure that number of seats at the room suffi-
cient for number of students at each group. The system provides a control panel for the
users with different tools that meet the users needs while remaining easy to understand
and use.
More specifically, this system is designed to allow an admin to generate the scheduale
or configure it manually, and he is the only person can full control the web site, add
courses, add professors, add rooms, add students and delete them all. other users can
view scheduale and interact with it simply.
Also the system fully intergrated with a forum for techincal and non-technical support
and professor announcements. And also integrated with vote system to allow admin to
check users opnion before publishing new scheduale.
